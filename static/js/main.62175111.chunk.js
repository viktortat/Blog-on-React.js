I acknowledge I was Welsh and we fell into conversation. The lovely lady had lived in Germany since the late 1960\'s and had acquired dual nationality . She spoke fluent German , her husband was German and her children lived in Stockholm. I think she wanted to speak English with a native speaker as we talked about touring, her friend in Cornwall, her parents who moved to Germany in later life and had since died and Brexit . She followed it closely despite not feeling British any more .\n    \n\n    It is odd how sometimes you fall into conversation with people you never meet again .
